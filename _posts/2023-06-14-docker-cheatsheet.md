## **Why you may want to read this article**

When I'm doing some infrastructure stuff I realized that I did it in the past about 1 year ago but now I don't remember anything. Then I end up googling it from scratch which is irritating, especially when you recall `exactly this article` that you cannot find for some reason now.

This article contains different useful docker-related guides, commands, and tutorials along with links that will include all the to-do steps for implementing various use cases.

## **Docker and Gitlab**


### **Locally build image, push/pull to Gitlab registry with authorization**

Actual on 2023-06-15.

Real-life example, I have node js application, and I would like to build it locally using docker and push it to the registry so my team can pull and run it. Or I can do that without building.

For that you need:

#### **1. Authenticate yourself in Gitlab registry**

[Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/authenticate_with_container_registry.html#use-gitlab-cicd-to-authenticate)

I used Personal access token approach (PAT).

To generate Personal Access Token: 
- go to your profile: `click on avatar on avatar -> Edit Profile`
- `go to Access Tokens`
- `create new one`, personally I specified all the scopes, but I guess you need only `write_registry` and `read_registry`


On local machine login using docker cmd

```
docker login -u <your-user-name-or-email> -p <personal-access-token> registry.gitlab.com/<your-group-name>/<your-project-name>
```

`<your-user-name-or-email>` - the login name that you are using when log in to Gitlab

`<personal-access-token>` - the PAT that you have generated above

`<your-group-name>` - the group when project is located, if you go from UI to container registry you can find it in the url [https://gitlab.com/your-group-name/your-project-name/container_registry](https://gitlab.com/your-group-name/your-project-name/container_registry)

`<your-project-name>` - the project name, if you go from UI to container registry you can find it in the url [https://gitlab.com/your-group-name/your-project-name/container_registry](https://gitlab.com/your-group-name/your-project-name/container_registry)

<br>

#### **2. Build image, from the folder where Dockerfile is located**

```
docker build -t registry.gitlab.com/<your-group-name>/<your-project-name>/<image-name> .
```

`<image-name>` - the image name that you would like to see in Gitlab UI.

<br>

#### **3. Push image**

```
docker push registry.gitlab.com/<your-group-name>/<your-project-name>/<image-name>
```

After this step you can observer image is added to your registry in Gitlab UI.

#### **4. Pull image**

Before pullilng images make sure your perform [1st step](https://andreyka26.com/docker-cheatsheet#1-authenticate-yourself-in-gitlab-registry)

```
docker pull registry.gitlab.com/<your-group-name>/<your-project-name>/<image-name>
```

#### **5. Run pulled image**


```
docker run registry.gitlab.com/<your-group-name>/<your-project-name>/<image-name>
```
