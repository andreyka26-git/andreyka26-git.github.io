# **What this article is about**

This is not a success story, because I didn’t pass the Amazon interview.

This is a story about my Amazon interview experience and why I didn’t like it compared to other FAANG companies. Besides that, I will answer questions like: **what exactly they asked, what were the coding tasks, what was system design question**.

In general, this article is about my experience: what interviews were, what was hard, what was not, how I prepared, and how much luck matters.


# **Start - Amazon offer**

One day, on September 6, I received this message on LinkedIn.


![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")


I agreed to an interview. At that time, Amazon interview process had three stages:



1. Online coding tasks without interviewer
2. 1-hour interview with one interviewer
3. Final round with 5 interviews, 1 hour each

# **Interviewing at Amazon**

From the moment I understood that I will interview at Amazon, I started grinding LeetCode, because it is my weakest part in interviews (at least I thought so). It was not going great, but slowly improving.

All interviews were online because of the COVID.

Now about the first stage.


# **First stage (done)**

At HackerRank I got 2 tasks, I solved only one. Important note: for each task I had to **explain the solution**.

Sorry for bad screenshots, I was afraid Amazon could detect screenshots 😅 Next ones are better.


### First problem

### Second problem

I didn’t solve it, brute force timed out, I needed dynamic programming.


![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")



# **Second stage (first try)**

I thought if I didn’t solve all the tasks - I'd be rejected. But then I got this email.


![alt_text](images/image5.png "image_tooltip")


I was surprised but happy.

After some time, they scheduled a second stage: 1-hour interview. I googled and understood Amazon loves **Leadership Principles** questions. So I learned all the principles, prepared examples from my small experience (3 years), and continued grinding LeetCode.

Interview day came (early October). We started talking, the interviewer explained the interview, and I realized I prepared for **completely wrong things**.

The interview was about **behavioral questions, Linux, and networking**. \
I've been a Windows user since I was 4 years old. My Linux experience was minimal, only some on-prem stuff for pet projects. Networking knowledge - only theoretical from books.

I didn’t record interview, but wrote down some questions:



* How to delete a file in Linux?
* You deleted a file but disk space is not freed, what to do?
* You see there is no internet on the machine, what to do?
* How to find the biggest file in Linux?
* How to pipe output from one command to another?
* The disk is full on the server, how to troubleshoot?
* In one region latency increased, others are fine, how to fix and troubleshoot?

Behavioral question I remember: \
**Tell me about a situation when you had an uncomfortable task and how you overcame it.**

After a few days, I got a rejection email.


![alt_text](images/image6.png "image_tooltip")


But then I got another email.


![alt_text](images/image7.png "image_tooltip")


Of course I agreed. My top career ambition is to be in FAANG.


# **Second stage (second try, done)**

This time interview was mostly behavioral questions like: \
“Tell me about a situation when you had a conflict with a colleague and how you resolved it and what impact it had on the project.”

I exaggerate, but in all interviews there were like **40-50 behavioral questions** (see stage 3). For me, it’s too much.

Luckily, feedback was positive and I moved to stage 3.


# **Preparation - LeetCode, books**

I won’t write much here, because nobody cares how a rejected guy prepared \
More details are in my Microsoft/Google/Snowflake interview article.

Shortly: I solved **114 LeetCode problems** and even recorded this moment.

I read **“System Design Interview”** (didn’t like it much) and reread **“Designing Data-Intensive Applications”** by Kleppmann (as always, amazing).


# **Third stage (reject)**

Amazon gives final round feedback by phone, which surprised me. I’ll describe all 5 interviews based on feedback analysis.


## 1 System design

The first interview was system design. I liked it. Not many behavioral questions (3-4), task was reasonable, interviewer was nice.

Later I found him on LinkedIn: 14 years at IBM and many years at Amazon. It was an honor to interview with him, especially on system design.

Task: design a **notification system** that sends notifications when requested by external services.

My solution (not perfect but meets requirements):


![alt_text](images/image8.png "image_tooltip")


Later from feedback I understood that my system design was **better than expected**. But good news ended there.


## 2 Coding

5-6 behavioral questions and trivial task: \
**find files with specific extension and size.**

Problem: I had no idea how to get file size from code, never did it before. I didn’t understand what the interviewer expected.

My solution:


![alt_text](images/image9.png "image_tooltip")


Actually, I should assume there are system calls returning file/directory objects. But they said the solution was OK.


## 3 Behavioral

Yes, full hour of questions like: \
“Tell me about a situation when you had conflict and how you solved it and what impact it had.”

They ask **8-13 questions per hour**.

I had 3 years of experience and ~10 prepared stories for leadership principles. I quickly ran out of stories and started reusing the same stories from different angles. It was annoying. Too much focus on this, in my opinion.

But feedback was OK.


## 4 Coding (or how I an Irish guy r*ped me)

From the start, the interviewer was not happy. I asked “how are you”, and got answer like: \
“as usual, no time for anything, but okay”.

The first question was an OOP task for Amazon lockers. Frankly I don’t know this concept in real life, there were no Amazon lockers in Ukraine back then. I didn’t understand the requirements and asked clarifying questions for ~20 minutes.


![alt_text](images/image10.png "image_tooltip")


By his tone, I felt he was doing his work in parallel. Probably the “rejection” decision was made during the first 10 minutes already.

After 20 minutes he stopped me: **“unfortunately we ran out of time”**. Then 3-4 behavioral questions.

Then, 20 minutes before the end, he gave another coding problem.


![alt_text](images/image11.png "image_tooltip")


Later I found out it was similar to LeetCode, but harder. \
Attaching the [discussion on the Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/545748/amazon-subsidiary-phone-concatenated-wor-uajg/) created by a guy who got exactly the same problem, and [variation of the problem on the Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenated-words/description/).

 \
I had 20 minutes left. I panicked and couldn't solve it.


![alt_text](images/image12.png "image_tooltip")


This is what I wrote (wrong solution). He asked for complexity, but interrupted again with **“unfortunately we ran out of time”**.

Honestly, if this was expected, I’m not on that level to solve it in 20 minutes with clarifying, coding, and complexity analysis.


## 5 Behavioral

Very nice person. The first half was relaxed, like chatting. In the second half he drilled into details so deeply that I felt like murder suspect and he is a detective.

Leadership principles questions are exhausting. I’m fine with them, but not so many.


# **Feedback**

Feedback was given by phone, no proof. Short version:


    You are a great guy, exceeded expectations in system design, but coding was very bad. So no, come back in 12 months.


# **Conclusions**

I read a lot about Amazon interview loops. People say luck matters a lot. Looks like I was unlucky, but I got experience.

Everything here I also told in my video, if you don’t want to read.

Thanks for reading, waiting for feedback!
